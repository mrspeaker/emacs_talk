* Emacs: passable text editor, instrument against our dystopian internet.

** DONE Intro
Earle Castledine, AKA Mr Speaker: Javascript flâneur, internet flibbertygibbert. Last gave a 20 minute talk at Queens.JS about making games. This was extended into an hour-long piece at Nodevember Conf in Nashville, and finally extended again into a recently-published 500 page book for SitePoint Publishing (HTML5 games: Novice to ninja). I will not be writing a book about Emacs.

Main points:
- You should need less tools that do more work - every extra tool is extra complexity and extra cognitive load
- Fads are not neutral - and text editors, most software,  are fads
- Emacs predicted our current mess, and is the perfect tool to combat it

** DONE Prelude
[Game fades in as Mario runs to the right towards spinning coins on the ground] 

Around the year 2005, us web developers were gifted a bunch of free coins: software and services that made our lives (and therefore web users' lives) more convenient. And we got *addicted* to convenience.

First came Ruby on Rails, then DOM libraries, then the rise of User Experience best practises. Followed by Douglas Crockford, and Linters and some other really cool tools. In a few short years the clunky, painful web of the past was behind us. 

Everything suddenly became so convenient and the road ahead was smoooth sailing.

[stop]

This brewed a storm of new tech that, on the surface, LOOKED like free coins: CDNs to make things faster, SAASs for everything, package managers, hosted anatlycs, hosted webfonts, javascript framworks... a cloud.

[start]  

The free coins ran out but we kept running forward because everything became so dang convenient...<We didn't appreciate the monetary value of extreme human profiling.>

... And now our productivity tools all require user logins. Our dev tools too. If not, they phone home every 30 minutes to check for "security updates". A tool is not useful unless it magically syncs with all our devices and our watches and our toasters and updates our google calanders.

<We didn't intentionaly do it, but we outsourced our tech pain to the almighty 3rd party provider. All they ask is we give frequent and detailed metadata about ourselves and our users and in return they give us, the internet.>

[its a trap]

It turns out that anything that calls a server or service that you don't *explicitly* control - anything that makes your life more convenient - has a cost beyond the monthly subscription fee. "Life is pain, anyone telling you differently is trying to sell you something".

[Reload] 

There was another path. (I'll still take jquery with me though). Before VSCode, or Atom, or Sublime Text, or Textmate, or Notepad++, or Homesite, or HotDog Pro? or Notepad... 

Back in 1985, Richard Stallman started the “Free Software Foundation” whose manifesto starts "'Free Software' means software that respects users' freedom and community.". Everyone knew back then that no software is neutral.

[Jumping up platforms] Unfortunately a lot of the FREE software is not outwardly appealing. It is sometimes dangerous, with sharp edges, and difficult, often ugly. It is not convenient.

A decade before even the Free Softawre Foundation, before 95% of the people watching this were even born, Richard Stallman and Guy Steele wrote a bit of software that embodied the Free Software manifesto that (I think) would hit its peak relevance 42 years later.

[Leave Prelude]

** DONE Level 0: Editing Text

[slide: level 0, editing text]

You might be saying "ummm, you're talking about a text editor, right?". Yes, the common understanding of emacs is that it's a text edtor. You'll often hear it in the phrase "tabs vs spaces, emacs vs vim". 

<I'm not doing a bike-shedding talk around *text editing*, because of all the topics to bikeshed about, your choice of editor is the most boring.>

[slide: picture of stove-top popcorn]

Luckily, Emacs is not a text edtior. Well, it is, but emacs is a text editor in the same way a saucepan is a popcorn maker. The most interesting parts of Emacs have very little to do with text editing. In fact, a venn diagram might looks more like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Venn:  (text ed circle should be tiny, eamcs encompanses most of "all other software")
   --------- -------------
 -/       --X-            \--
/        /    \    all       \
(  text ( emacs)   other      )
\   ed   \    /   softwar    /
 -\       --X-     ever   /--
   --------- -------------

#+END_EXAMPLE

So, yes - part of it is a text editor so let's start there. 

[screen shot of default emacs, with logo]

That's actually the Emacs logo. This is the first impression they actually decided to give you when you install Emacs. This is your first trial. Emacs does everything in its power to keep make you uninstall in your first week. It's ugly. It's confusing.

It's ugliness is a feature - you're forced to learn a lot about the environment trying to make it look not so bad. If you succeeed, then that's half the battle right there.

[screen shot of my current setup]

The rest of the battle is a lot longer and harder. You might be surprised to find that next big challenge is learning to move the cursor around.

[screen shot of cursor move]

Yes, to move around you use the handy ctrl + f-b-n-p keys. To do anything in Emacs you have to memorise some (seemingly) ludcrious keybinds. 

Others you just have to look up everytime. Accordingly they made a really powerful help system - that should give you a clue about it's usability.

[more keybinds]

The first few days of Emacs is just memorizing weird keybinds. You can see that the ctrl and alt versions of commands generally are parallels of each other - but there's not always nice logic. For times when you just need to "bookmark-file-this-dir-all-tags-regexp-other-window" it's often better to just use M-x with tab completion to find your function.

The core idea with emacs keybinds is to stay as close to the home row as possible. That's why cursors are fbnp, not arrow keys - the arrows are just too far away from the home row. It also means you MUST be a good touch typist. I thought I was until I started using Emacs.

[Kill and yank] 

ctrl-w to cut (kill), ctrl-y to (yank)... kill to the kill ring, and yank FROM the kill ring back into the page. Seriously. WHY, why would they not use standard tings? BECUASE cut & paste did not exist when emacs was invented. it didn't exist!

Like JavaScript, once you understand and forgive the historical WATs, you see that that many other WATs are actually very interesting features.  It can do everything you expect , but also has a tonne of really cool tricks up it's sleeve. that "kill ring" becoes a history of past cuts - go around cutting stuff, pasting it somewhere else (instead of cut, paste, select both parts, cut again...) . 

[Readline]

bonus: if you're a command line fan ctrl-a ctrl-e, ctrl-s... may seem familiar? [[https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html][GNU Readline]] Library - now that you've learned emacs, you can move around the command line! same tings! including the kill ring. Once you're good at emacs, then long lines of commandline become much easier to mess around with.

[game: finish level]

** DONE Level 1: Modes and Packages

Now things get more interesting. The payoff for memorizing stupid keybinds is that the same keybinds are applicable accross "modes".

[img of modes]

Modes define the behavior of the current documnet. A Major mode is the main "type" of a document - like this JS-IDE mode which nows how to treat the text as javascript.

Tetris mode, sunshine mode, org-mode for organising, file managment... emacs has A LOT of major modes. 

Additionally a buffer can have many "minor" modes - additional behaviours that are applicable accross major modes - like spell checking.

Sooo much stuff is baked into emacs by default.- it has THREEE irc clients built in. THREE! Three web browsers of various capablilites. Two email clients, a spreadsheet, a dungeon crawler text adventures, pong, snake, a news reader,  a couple of hex editors, a VIM emulator!, a bunch of shells and terminals, moonphases, calendars and scheduling, a crazy powerful scientific cacluator, so many mail clients.
i THINK it has a gopher client. All built in by default.

While I was preparing this talk I thought "i bet it has something that generates morse code. I wrote some text, and typed M-x morse and hit tab...

[-.--/./.../--..-- -/...././.-./. ../...!] (M-x morse-region)

I'll quickly show you some examples of more useful modes.

[dired]
edit the directory as if it were a text document: find and replace, scripts

[ftp]
remote file management and editing is exactly the same as local.

[example: magit] 
If you're editing something that happens to be part of a git repository, triggering magit mode gives you an very powerful git commit mode: using all your favourite weird keybinds - move around a repo loking at things. S to stage chunks.... 

[pic: shell/HN]
hackernew, shell, web browser: all SAME keybinds and you can treat all of the apps the same way. The point isn't that emacs has a git client - it's that it has *everything*... and you don't need to context switch when you're in the flow. You only have to master one app and you've mastered them all.

They aren't as shiny and convenient as a fancy TODO  app, Standard keybinds make this not insane. Once you've learned the weirdness of keys, you apply that knowedge to ALL of these modes. It's an operating sytem  where most programs are the same program. And none of them will track you.

Emacs is a plain old saucepan that replaces a million shiny standalone appliences like egg poachers, popcorn maker, and chocolate fountains - that you use once then leave in the cupboard.

You just live in Emacs. I don't remember the keyboard shortcut to close it. 

** DONE Level 100: DIY
Everything in emacs is meant to be customized. To faciliate this, the almost the entire system is written in Lisp and is interpreted as you use it.

The editor is a ball of mutable state, and it's LISp all the way down. The keybinds I showed you earlier all execute lisp functions. If you want to write your own functionality for the eidtor you can use these functions in your own scripts.

[init.el] unlike most - your setting/profile file is lisp instructions. If you want to change a setting, execute some lisp in the environement. If you want to keep the settings, addit to your emacs file to be executed on launch. IT's lisp all the way down

wehn I talked about keybinds earlier I said that C-f was move forward a character. It is actually a shortcut to execute the function `forward-char`.

[move up down example]
- C-h c -> get command info, sleect: see code. Own, library, native.
- see hte code for everything. change and execute in place. Add to your init.el file, and it's permanetn
;; Move lines up/down with M-p and M-n - write this live?

emacs defaults are often terrible... learnign to fix the terrible things is how you learn emacs and how you get confident to change everything.

Macros
[macros]
--- easy useful, use them text - but works on ALL THE OTHER stuff: same as edign your TODO notes as bulk renaming files on a remote ftp server.

** DONE Bonus round: Org mode

Bonus round: org-mode. Org mode is a gateway drug to Emacs. It's the "killer app". A lot of people use Emacs ONLY for org-mode.

Org is an emacs major mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and project planning with a fast and effective plain-text markup language - kind of like markdown, but far more feature rich. It also is an authoring system with unique support for literate programming and reproducible research.

It supports ToDo items, deadlines and time stamps, which magically appear in the diary listing of the Emacs
calendar. You can make tables with forumlas and other spreadsheet functionality, You can inject and execute code in any language - making it a great tool for litterate programming and repoducable research (like Jupyter notebooks), org files can be exported as a structured ASCII, markdown, or HTML file.

[M-x artist mode]

another emacs-sized monster inside of emacs. I use it for everything - note taking, work planning, time keeping, I used one to write the talk, another to make the levels for this game!

If your feeling tempted to try out Emacs, then start by making it your note-taking tool with org-mode, and hopefully you get hooked from there.

** DONE Level infinity

That was a speedrun. I touched on an tiny small amount of emacs features. It is a deep rabbit hole and there's so much to explore. People use emacs for *decades* and still find new things they didn't know about. I guess I currently know 4% of Emacs.

Emacs is a box full of paradox: it's clunky and elegant, it's ugly and beautiful, its' frustrating and delightful, it's archaeic and ahead of its time. 

The most powerful aspect I've found is that I've started using fewer and fewer external tools or third-party applications - you feel the simlarites in tasks and stay in the flow. It's made made me suspicious of every shiney new productivity or schduling tool. Everytime I have to create an account or sign up to use some software, everytime I see a web page trying to load 30 analytics scripts...

[most tech startups could be replaced by an emacs minor mode]

[Game goes back to start, showing "FUTURE>"]

So, choose wisely! Nobody should control your dev tools, and nobody needs to be tracking your every move - no matter how convenient the product. Perhaps try making things a bit harder on yourself and give emacs a go!


* ---- scrap ---
A couple of years ago I found a grey hair on my head... 6 months ago the first appeared in my stubble. By chance, Microsoft purchased GitHub which meant they also just purchased my go-to text editor, Atom. Atom was already starting to feel the  ... 1976 I was born, in the same year Richard Stallman created emacs.

notepad => homesite => notepad++  => textmate => vim? nope... sublime => atom => vscode? nope... => emacs. 20 years wasting my time. 20 years of half-arsing it.  I will be using emacs on the day i die.
...  was Atom, but I saw the world moving to VSCode so I decided not to fight it and learned emacs

conveninece is hte enemy of progress.

Before I started using emacs I thought I could touch type. Emacs showed me that I could touch type this regex /[a-zA-Z0-9]/ and that's about it. - so you think you can touch type?

The other day I noticed my blog was taking a long time to load - looked at it. Over 5Mb of non-essential http requests-  5 different third parties, including setting cookies on doubleclick. I was giving all the details of anyone who read my blog to random companies, thinking I wasn't tracking them at all. How did I let this happen? How did we get here?


This is a talk about emacs. Even though you can't be told what emacs is, you have to discover it for yoursef. Kind of like Monads. And like monads - when you discoverd ahve to do a talk about it, even though it's pointless because no one can be told. Especially in just 20 minutes.

Started good, but evil chipped away. Stallman warned us, but we didn't listen. I didn't listen. I thought I could use non-free tools in a responsible way. I thought everythign was inherently good. Or at least neutral. 

Death by 1000 cuts, lured by convenience, and "Great user experience", and buitfiul interfaces... all papering over the tiny evil underneath. ... but not all is lost.  in the background this whole time, the software we deserve



How many modes built-in? Lets just say Emacs suits people who are more confortable in choas than in order. Do you have 50 tabs opened at the same time? Is your destkop littered iwth files, including a folder called "Desktop" that contains more misc files also with a folder called "destkop"? Emacs is like this but for folders, files, and applications

You can feel the age in it - it's not a new bit software and it shows. There are some efforts to bring it up to date - Remacs is a Rust implementaiton that aims to modernize the internals. But I'm not sure it's needed. Emacs feels like you are exploring a run-down mansion - you migh hurt yourself, you might find a mummy or frankestein or something, but you also might find the room full of treasure.

--- the way you use apps inside emacs does vary, but the way you find out how they vary is consistent - help system. RTFM is the only way. You can find everything if you dig hard enough. If you were stuck on a desert island (or wifi-free long-haul flight) and could only take one bit of software - that bit of software MUST be emacs.

 Emacs could have told you that 1976!


 is a tool for now. made in 1976 especially for 2019.

nobody should own your dev tools... they should be free, and battle testedYou get to make choices about the internet you live in. now youre at a crossroads, Make sure you're not just adicted to conveninece and that the shiny next-big-thing dev tool is really 


it's antisocial. it's ugly. it's won't hold your hand. But it can't be comercialized or corrupted. It lives simulataneously in the past and the future. It's Emacs.

- install a new package, works how you expect: g refresh eg, n/p... dired c-v/m-v all same. 

> look at analytics calls from ftp clients, note taking etc. Emacs is too old to disrespect your privacy, and it doens't care about you anywya. : show log of http requests (lil' snitch). Software is tracking you, grinding you down...  it needs to to survive.
